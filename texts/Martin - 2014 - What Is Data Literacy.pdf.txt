Editorial
What is Data Literacy?
Elaine R. Martin, DA, Director of Library Services
University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester, MA, USA
What is data literacy? Why is data literacy
important? Data literacy is “the ability to
read, create, and communicate data as information” (Wikipedia). The evolutionary role of
the librarian in offering data literacy services
  including discussion about the skills needed by students and researchers for data literacy and development of effective instructional content, methods, and formats   continues to evolve. What is clear is that data literacy services offer librarians an opportunity to
expand their role in the research enterprise
within an institution.
As research funders in the U.S., the U.K.,
and Canada are increasingly mandating
open access to research data, researchers 
responsibilities towards managing their data
are changing. Researchers are being required to improve and enhance their research data management skills and practices. By providing research data literacy services and instructional programs, librarians
can engage with the biomedical research
community within their institutions in new
ways. But exactly what kinds of data literacy
services can librarians offer? How can librarians successfully engage with faculty,
students, and researchers in order to offer
and market these instructional programs?
The answers are varied and many. The articles in this issue of the JESLB are designed
to offer some guidance to those librarians
interested in offering research data literacy

services in their institutions. These articles
highlight practical resources and strategies
for offering one or more in-person or online
courses to researchers, students and librarians on the topic of best practices for scientific research data management.
The New England Collaborative Data Management Curriculum (NECDMC) is one example of a data management curriculum.
Designed collaboratively by librarians from
New England academic intuitions, it was created for the purpose of using one or more
modules to instruct other librarians and researchers about the need for, and use of,
good research data management practices.
The articles by Eaker, Peters, Ishida, O Malley, and Muilenberg discuss how this particular curriculum can be customized and offered in unique ways depending on the institution and target audience. Kafel and her
colleagues outline how the curriculum was
designed as well as the challenges of collaborative curriculum development. Cox et al.
present an alternative approach to collaborative curriculum design developed with the
University of Sheffield Information School
and the libraries at the Universities of Leeds,
Sheffield, and York. Another well-known
curriculum called MANTRA is an online
course from the University of Edinburgh.
Rice discusses its many releases and plans
for the future.

Building data services goes hand in hand
with developing data literacy instruction.
While there is growing discussion in the literature about how to develop data services in
academic libraries, Coates offers specific
strategies and resources for building relationships with busy researchers, demonstrating the value of a librarian on the research
team, and advocating for good research
practices. Mischo and his colleagues, on the
other hand, focus one type of data service  
assisting researchers in writing their NSF
data management plans. After reviewing
funded and non-funded NSF grants with data management plans and their differences,
it appears that researchers do respond positively to librarians offering assistance in identifying storage mechanisms.
The time is ripe to develop the role of librarians in defining and delivering data information literacy programs and services. Instructing researchers, students, and librarians in data literacy is truly an emerging area
of need and one in which librarians can play
a significant role. As evidenced by the articles in this special issue of the Journal of
eScience Librarianship, librarians are poised
to expand their roles as providers of data
information literacy. I hope this issue will be
a useful point of reference for the development of curriculum and dissemination strategies.
